# :billed_cap: Pokemon App

This project is a simple react native study using [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

## :red_circle: PokeApi
The [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) is an open restfull api for pokemon data, serving over 250,000,000 API calls each month. It is a consumption-only API â€” only the HTTP GET method is available on resources. No authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available.

## :pencil2: Desing Screens

In the first instance, the intention would only be to list the pokemons and a detail screen for each one.

The propotyping was done using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and you can access the project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZPDMLBhBsKrOTTS1uqazrH/Pokemon-app?node-id=0%3A1).
